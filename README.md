# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditya Parekh (@adparekh)

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Waterloo, passionate about building intelligent systems and scalable software. I love solving real-world problems at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Data Engineering**, and **Full-Stack Development**.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🤖 **Machine Learning** – Experienced in developing and deploying ML models using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. Past projects include facial reenactment pipelines, question answering systems, and time series forecasting.
- 🛠️ **Full-Stack Development** – Skilled with React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL to build clean, responsive, and performant web apps.
- 🗃️ **Data Engineering** – Built large-scale ETL pipelines with PySpark and AWS Glue, and automated reporting with BI tools like QuickSight and Tableau.
- ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps** – Familiar with AWS, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines to ship and scale applications reliably.

## 📈 Current Focus

I'm currently expanding my skills in:
- Building and scaling MLOps workflows with tools like **MLflow**, **Ray**, and **Docker/Kubernetes**
- Designing efficient backend APIs and microservices
- Exploring cross-domain applications of ML in product analytics and personalization
